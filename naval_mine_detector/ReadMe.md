### Project Name : Naval Mine Detector 

##### Technology : Deep Learning with Neural network using Python 

##### Description : 

• Mine detection and classification using side scan sonar imagery is a challenging problem.

• As opposed to the majority of techniques,several Neural-network-based methods for the detection and classification of mines and mine like objects have been proposed. 

• Detection and classification of underwater objects in sonar imagery is a complicated problem, due to various factors such as variations in operating and environmental conditions, presence of spatially varying clutter, variations in target shapes, compositions and orientation. 

• By using the concept of Deep learning with Neural network we predict whether object is Mine or not.
