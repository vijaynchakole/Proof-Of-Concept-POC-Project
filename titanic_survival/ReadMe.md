## Project Name : Titanic Survival Predictor 

#### Technology : Supervised Machine Learning with Logistic Regression, Decision tree and Random Forest using Python 

Description : 
• This application is based on supervised machine learning technique. 
•  There is one data set which contains information about all passengers from titanic such as its name, age, seat number , ticket price, height, floor etc.
• We first clean the data set by removing unnecessary entries and columns. 
• We multiple Algorithms for predicting results and based on evaluation matrix, we have chose Logistic Regression model . 
•  We apply Logistic regression technique  using cross-validation technique to train our dataset and predict whether the passenger can survive or not depends on its data entries.
